This is a mid-level educational tutorial.

IMDb provides subsets of their website's data. Read about it [here](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/), and download them [here](https://datasets.imdbws.com/).

After the files are decompressed, they can be used to create SQL files. The [Wiki](https://github.com/joefissk/imdb-data-into-postgresql/wiki) for this repo will walk you through the process.
